# 🐜 Ant Simulation
An interactive Python-based simulation modeling the behavior of ants in a dynamic environment!
Ants search for food, leave pheromone trails, and collaboratively adapt to changing conditions.

# ✨ Features
Realistic Ant Behavior: Follows pheromone gradients, food-seeking, and returning to the nest.

Dynamic Environment: Pheromone trails decay over time, encouraging exploration.

Interactive Interface: Visualize ant movement and environment updates in real time.

Customizable Parameters: Easily tweak simulation settings like the number of ants, pheromone strength, and decay rates.
